## Kiwiboom's Minecraft Scripts
# Avatar
This is handy for people that want to integrate avatars with Minecraft skins. Just upload the 'avatar.php' file to your server. Now you can navigate to the avatar file with your browser. An example avatar call looks like this: 'avatar.php?p=kiwiboom&size=100'. In this particular example the script will get kiwiboom's skin, cut out the head and resize it too 100x100 pixels.
